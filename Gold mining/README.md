## Project's goal<a id='goal'></a>

Our goal is to prepare **prototype of a machine learning model** for the gold mining company. This company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.
The model should **predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore**. We have the data on extraction and purification. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.
The metric for the task - sMape.
It is similar to MAE, but is expressed in relative values instead of absolute ones. It equally takes into account the scale of both the target and the prediction.
