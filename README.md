## [Gaming platform analysis]<a id='game'></a>
 
 In this project I've analyzed released games:
 * Determined how many games are there per each year, chose a suitable date interval for analysis
 * Analyzed gaming platforms, choose most popular through years, found game platform life cycle
 * Selected the most promising platform
 * Determined the impact of the review on game sales
 * Analysed data per region of sale, and game genre
 * Tested the following hypotheses:
    - Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same
    - Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. 
 
**Key words**: games, hypotheses testing  

**Libraries used**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, scipy, matplotlib
