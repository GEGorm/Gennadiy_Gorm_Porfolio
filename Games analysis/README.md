This project was completed during Yandex.Practicum Data Scientist professional program.

**Key words**: testing hypotheses, games.

**Libraries used**: pandas, plotly, seaborn, scipy, matplotlib

## Project's goal<a id='goal'></a>

We work for the online store Ice, which **sells video games** all over the world. 
We need to **identify patterns** that determine whether a **game succeeds or not**. This will allow to **spot potential big winners** and **plan advertising campaigns**.

In this project I've analyzed released games:

Determined how many games are there per each year, chose a suitable date interval for analysis
Analyzed gaming platforms, choose most popular through years, found game platform life cycle
Selected the most promising platform
Determined the impact of the review on game sales
Analysed data per region of sale, and game genre
Tested the following hypotheses:
Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same
Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
